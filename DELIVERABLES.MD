# DELIVERABLES

## Description

Next up we’ll be creating a basic calculator app that functions like this example. Again don’t be fooled; a calculator is not as easy to create as it seems.
This project is going to continue your learning with Javascript. Much of what you’ll work on here is going to continue to deepen your programming and logic skills.
KEEP IN MIND: Don’t worry about the styling. You can always revisit the look and feel of the app later. Spend your time on using Javascript to make the calculator work correctly.

## Expected Time To Complete

1 week

## Project will be written in:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Restrictions

- No Javascript libraries or frameworks are allowed
- Do not use the eval() function in Javascript - it is considered unsafe.
- No following tutorials of calculator apps/projects
- No copying code of other existing calculator apps/projects

## Deliverables

- Project should be in a Git repository on GitHub
- You should make regular (daily) Git commits to the project
- Calculator should be able to:
  - Add two numbers
  - Subtract two numbers
  - Multiply two numbers
  - Divide two numbers
  - Display at least 10 digits on the screen
  - Display decimals to at least the thousandth (.001)
  - Perform continuous functions
    - Example:
      - Press the 1 button
      - Press the add button
      - Press the 1 button
      - Press the add button again (result should show as 2 on the screen)
      - Press the 1 button
      - Press the add button again (result should show as 3 on the screen)
      - Pressing the clear button resets screen to 0
  - Optional:
    - Add a memory save button (M+)
    - Add a memory clear button (M-)
    - Add a memory recall button (MR)
